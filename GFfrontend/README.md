# **Gator-forum**
## **Introduction**
Basically, Gator-forum is similar to any other forums, like Stack Overflow, Douban, Quora, Redditâ€¦ But we hope it is more student-life related instead of society-related or limited in specific field.

A few gator forums have been discovered:
-   [https://insidethegators.com/forums/1](https://insidethegators.com/forums/1)
-   [https://247sports.com/college/florida/Board/Florida-Gators-Message-Board-Forum-14/](https://247sports.com/college/florida/Board/Florida-Gators-Message-Board-Forum-14/)

-   [https://gatorchatter.com/forums/main-sports-forum.20/](https://gatorchatter.com/forums/main-sports-forum.20/)

But they seem to be all sports-related. Although lots of students have a huge interest in sports, we do not want to only focus on sports. We want to create a place where people can not only discuss about sports, but also lots of things including their courses, their professors, their daily life, their hobbies and so on. They can share whatever they like and legal on Gator-forum.
